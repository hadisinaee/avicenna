# How to use `Avicenna`?
To use `Avicenna`, you need to follow three steps:
1. Setup a site with `Avicenna`
2. Customize the site to your needs
3. Build your site and deploy it to your host

The following sections are based on the mentioned steps.
# 1. How to setup a site with `Avicenna`?
There are 2 ways to install `Avicenna`:
1. The first one is a step-by-step approach that you could use to install it. 
2. The second one is just an automated script based on the first approach. 

Pick the one that works for you well. Also, I provided a link to a video clip showing the whole process of installation for both approaches.

## 1. Step-by-Step Installation
1. You need to install [Hugo][1] first!
2. Create a new site and go to the directory:
```bash
# replace the `my_cool_page` with whatever you want!
hugo new site my_cool_page

# move to your project folder
cd my_cool_page
```

3. Add the stable release of `Avicenna` (the `master` branch) to your `themes` folder:
```bash
git clone -b master git@github.com:hadisinaee/avicenna.git ./themes/avicenna
```

4. Copy the sample site to your project:
```bash
cp -R themes/avicenna/exampleSite/* ./
```

5. Run the site:
```bash
hugo serve
```

Now, you should be able to see the site at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/)

## 2. Automated Script
In this approach, all you need is to replace the `my_cool_page` with your desired name in the following script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadisinaee/avicenna/master/setup_avicenna.sh && sh setup_avicenna.sh my_cool_page
```

Run the site:
```bash
hugo serve
```

Now, you should be able to see the site at http://localhost:1313

# 2. How to Customize `Avicenna`?

## Start With the `config.toml`
You can start the customization with the `config.toml` file. It's located a the root of your project. In this file, you can set your name, your website URL, googleAnalytics id, etc.

## Adding Your Profile Picture, CV, and Favicon
There is a folder named `static` under the root of your site's folder. Its structure is as follows:

![static_folder](./static_folder.png)

- **Profile Picture**: Simply replace `profile.png` with your profile file. Please use the same name and extenstion, e.g. `profile.png`. It doesn't work if you use another *name* or *extension*.
- **CV**: You need to put your CV directly under `static` folder. I recommend you to use the name `cv.pdf` for your CV file. Also, if you wanted to use another file name, you would need to change it in your introduction. See Introduction Section.
- **Favicon**: It has the same procedure as your profile picture.

## Content
All files and folders that you need to modify lies in the `content` folder. The folder should look like this

![the content folder structure](avicenna_folder.png)

Avicenna theme has three different sections: `Introduction`, `Publications`, and `Projects`. Based on the previous figure, you might have an intuition where you should modify. However, there are some details that I have to provide.

## `Introduction` Section
`Introduction` section is where you put details about yourself, such as your name, profile, interests, etc. To modify the introduction section, you need to edit the `content/about/_index.md` file.

## `Publications` Section
All your publications are stored in `content/publications`. To create a new publication:

```
hugo new publications/your-pub-name.md
```

If was successful, you would see a message similar to the following:

```
YOUR_PROJECT_PATH/content/publications/your-pub-name.md
```

To edit the file, go to `content/publications` and then find your `your-pub-name.md` file and change it.


## Project Section
All your projects are stored in `content/projects`. To create a new project:

```
hugo new projects/your-project-name.md
```

If was successful, you would see a message similar to the following:

```
YOUR_PROJECT_PATH/content/projects/your-project-name.md
```

To edit the file, go to `content/projects` and then find your `your-project-name.md` file and change it.


# 3. How to Deploy `Avicenna`?
1. Make sure you have changed your `baseURL` in the `config.toml` file. It should be the address you want to deploy `Avicenna` on.
2. Run `hugo` in the root of your project. The result will be in the `public` folder in the root of your project.
3. Copy `public` folder and move it your host server.
